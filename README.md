# DnD-Character-Creator-Android-App
 A comprehensive character creator for dungeons and dragons.
 This is my first big app and has a lot of boilerplate, inefficient
 and hard to read code but it shows my first steps as a programmer.
 I intend to update it and bring it up to date with my skills.

Updating this app proves difficult. 
It won’t run on my PC and screams of missing databinding when I have all files present.
Also there seems to be a problem with the database.
I will give it a few more days to try to figure it out.
If I’m still stuck, I might move on to other projects and not waste time here.

I’m unable to fix it in a reasonable timeframe.
I will move on to other projects to enhance my skills.
I may rewrite this someday.
